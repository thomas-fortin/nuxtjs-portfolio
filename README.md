# NuxtJS Portfolio

_This project is still in progress. I work on it during my free time (sometimes difficult to find...)._

This repository contains my website made with the framework NuxtJs. This is also a pretext to test some packages and new (front) technologies.

This website is not online (yet), but you can access to all of the source code !

## Features

* SCSS + Tailwind + BEM
* Firestore
* i18n
* SEO + Rich Snippets

## Why ?

I built this project to practice on a recent framework that I particularly appreciate. Moreover, I decided to put this repository as "Public" to show the way I work, and maybe give some "How to with Nuxt.js..." answers for some persons.

Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions. My social links are in the code above :)

## For now...

Here is the current look of the homepage :
